<p>Concept of equity in education
“Equity” focuses on taking those 
opportunities presented to students
 and infusing them with support and 
resources to turn the education system
 into a level playing field. This means 
that disadvantaged students will get the 
support they need to become equal to students 
who are not disadvantaged.</p>
